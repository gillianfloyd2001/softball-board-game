# softball-board-game

This is a frontend app that I developed for school.

The game will random place the ball and the girl in a random square
and you will use the arrow keys to move the glove. Everytime you catch the ball it will give you a point and it will move the ball to another square it keeps moving the ball until you refresh the page.
